    <h2>The Complexity of U.S. Politics</h2>
    <p>
        The United States has a unique and complex political structure. With a federal government divided into three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—it ensures checks and balances. This article explores the political landscape, including prominent figures like Donald Trump, his administration, and business magnate Elon Musk's influence.

    <h2>Donald Trump's Administration and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>
        Donald Trump served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. His presidency marked a period of significant polarization in American politics. Trump's first Chief of Staff, <strong>Reince Priebus</strong>, played a critical role in shaping the early administration. Later, figures like <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> as Secretary of State and <strong>Steven Mnuchin</strong> as Secretary of the Treasury gained prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
        His administration was known for its "America First" policies, tax reforms, and efforts to renegotiate international trade agreements. Despite controversies, his leadership significantly altered U.S. domestic and foreign policies.

    <h2>The United States Congress: Power and Influence</h2>
    <p>
        The U.S. Congress, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, is the legislative powerhouse. During Trump's presidency, the <strong>Republican-controlled Senate</strong>, led by figures like <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>, supported many of his policies. The <strong>Democratic-controlled House</strong>, under Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, frequently clashed with Trump's administration, especially during the impeachment processes.
